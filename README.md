A*(A Star) Algorithm is written in JavaScript

Path Finding Algorithm.<br/>

There are M*N nodes on field. Each of colors mean a assignment:<br/>
*green - start of way, *red - end of way, *gray - a obstacle,<br/>
*blue - node has been visited, *darkblue - node hasn't been visited.<br/>
Way is built by yellow rectangles from red node to green node to line up most efficient way.<br/>
You can change position of red node and green node via keys Shift and Ctrl respectively.<br/>
Also you can put obstacle on way: you need to click on the node. To remove a obstacle click on it.<br/>
